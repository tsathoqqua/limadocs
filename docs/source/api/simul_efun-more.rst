Functions
=========
.. c:function:: varargs string tail(string fname, int nlines)

This version is slightly extended and compatible in spirit, but doesn't
reproduce the oddities of the original tail() efun.  Note that it also
returns the string, so write(tail(fname)) is needed for strict
compatibility.


.. c:function:: varargs nomask void more(mixed arg, int num, function continuation, int output_flags)

more(arg) starts up more to display the array of lines 'arg'.  If arg is
a string, it is exploded around "\n".  An optional second argument gives
the number of lines per chunk.  An optional continuation function will
be evaluated when the "more" is completed.


.. c:function:: varargs nomask void more_file(mixed arg, int num, function continuation, int output_flags)

more_file(arg) starts up more to display the single file 'arg' if 'arg'
is a string, or more than one file if 'arg' is an array of strings.
An optional second argument gives the number of lines per chunk.  An
optional continuation function will be evaluated when the "more" is
completed.
