Documentation for the simul_efun-path api in */secure/simul_efun/path.c*.

Functions
=========
.. c:function:: string cannonical_form(mixed fname)

Change object path names to standard form, stripping the trailing .c, if
any, the clone number, if any, and making sure the leading / exists.

This function is useful for making sure that alternate forms of the
pathname match correctly, since:
cannonical_form("foo/bar") == cannonical_form("/foo/bar.c")


.. c:function:: string canonical_path(string path)

Strip out all "." and ".." forms from a path.  Remove double slashes.
Ensure the path has a leading slash.
