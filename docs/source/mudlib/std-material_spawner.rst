Mudlib *material_spawner*
**************************

Documentation for the std-material_spawner functions for the mudlib in */std/material_spawner.c*.

Functions
=========
.. c:function:: void set_material_file(string f)

Sets the file cloned when the player finds something.


.. c:function:: void set_success_action(string a)

Sets the action that happens when the player finds something. Since
you can use the yield() function to return more than one thing, the syntax
here is extended to include how many you find.
i.e.
  set_success_action("$N $vsearch the blackberry bush, and $vfind <wild blackberry>!");

The action follows all other rules for these simple_action() calls.


.. c:function:: void set_search_string(string ss)

Sets the string used when the player is search.
See 'man busy_with'.
i.e. set_search_string("searching for the trashcan");


.. c:function:: void set_fail_action(string a)

Sets the action that happens when the action fails.


.. c:function:: int yield()

Returns the number of things given to the player by the material spawner.
Override this and add random() or fixed numbers as you like.
