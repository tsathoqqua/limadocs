Documentation for the adversary-skills functions for the mudlib in */std/adversary/skills.c*.

Functions
=========
.. c:function:: int aggregate_skill(string skill)

This value is a simple sum of the set skill value for the mob if any
+ the query_level() of the monster.


.. c:function:: void set_skill(string name, int sp)

This provides a simple way to set skills for adversaries.
Example @.here:guard->set_skill("combat/melee/club",1000);

No need to set "combat" as well for adversaries since the skills do
not aggregate like for players with bodies. Once set, a skill cannot be changed.
Use force_skill() to override this restriction.


.. c:function:: void force_skill(string name, int sp)

This provides a simple way to set skills for adversaries.
Example @.here:guard->force_skill("combat/melee/club",1000);

Unlike set_skill(), force_skill() in adversary can set a skill even if set previously.


.. c:function:: int base_test_skill(string skill, int opposing_skill)

Test whether this adversary' skill succeeds against a given opposing skill
level.  Returns 1 for success of this user.


.. c:function:: varargs int test_skill(string skill, int opposing_skill, int no_learn)

This is the basic skill test for adversaries.
For players it is replaced by an extended version, supporting the
improvement of skills through use.
