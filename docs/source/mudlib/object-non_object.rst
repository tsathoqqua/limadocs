Documentation for the object-non_object functions for the mudlib in */std/object/non_object.c*.

Functions
=========
.. c:function:: int remove()

This function is guaranteed to be called when an object is destructed.
It tidies up some things like updating its environment's capacity and
light level.  It also calls the "remove" hook.


.. c:function:: mixed receive_object(object target, string relation)

receive_object(obj, relation) should return 1 if obj can be put ("in", "on",
etc) the object, where 'relation' specifies the relation.  By default,
objects cannot contain things so MOVE_NOT_ALLOWED is returned.  See also
the container inheritable.


.. c:function:: varargs void set_attached(int a)

set_attached(1) or set_attached() sets the ATTACHED flag for this
object, and set_attached(0) removes it.


.. c:function:: int is_attached()

returns 1 if the ATTACHED flag is set for this object.
