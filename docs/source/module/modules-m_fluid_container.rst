.. c:function:: varargs int can_hold_fluid(mixed ob)

When fluid is passed into the fluid
container, this function is called with
the fluid object as the argument.  returns
1 by default, but this function can be
overridden if this container is limited
in the types of fluids it can hold.

'x' is evaluated if this
container cannot hold the fluid
that is being put into it.


.. c:function:: void set_full_action(mixed x)

'x' is evaluated when this container
is full of fluid and can hold no more.
If it is a string, it is passed to
my_action().


.. c:function:: void move_fluid(object ob)

Moves fluid to fill the continer - if successful
it fills the container


.. c:function:: void part_move_fluid(object ob)

Moves fluid to fill the continer - if successful the quantity
transferred is limited to the original quantity
