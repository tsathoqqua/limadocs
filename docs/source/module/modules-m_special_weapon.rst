Documentation for the modules-m_special_weapon module in */std/modules/m_special_weapon.c*.

Module Information
==================

This module can be used to create magical / special weapons for the mud. It includes randomization functions
for materials and spell-like powers. These powers ranged from common (less powerful) to very rare powers (very
powerful). The weapons can be upgraded using the

  void upgrade_weapon_material() -- chance to upgrade the material to the next tier.
  void upgrade_weapon_attack()   -- chance to upgrade the attack level to the next tier.

These functions should be interfaced from a smith or other NPC that takes some materials, money etc. to attempt an
upgrade. The item will increase in value automatically once upgraded.
