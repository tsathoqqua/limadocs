Functions
=========
.. c:function:: int is_stateful()

Override this to make the object stateful depending on what happens.
E.g. a torch might be stateful when lighted, but not when it's dark.


.. c:function:: int state_update()

This function must return 1 by stateful objects to keep being called by STATE_D. If they do not, they're removed from
the queue. If they do, they're added to the queue again by STATE_D and set to be called after query_call_interval()
minutes has passed.


.. c:function:: int set_call_interval(int i)

int set_call_interval(int i)
Set call interval in minutes.


.. c:function:: int query_call_interval()
