**********************

Documentation for the modules-m_blockexits module in */std/modules/m_blockexits.c*.

Module Information
==================

Module for NPCs that need to block exits for players - and stop doing so
under certain conditions.

.. TAGS: RST

Functions
=========
.. c:function:: void add_block(string *exits...)

Adds the exits specified to the list of exits this object is blocking
'all' can be used to block all exits


.. c:function:: void remove_block(string *exits...)

Removes the exits specified to the list of exits this object is blocking


.. c:function:: void set_block_action(mixed ba)

If given a string, that 'targetted_action' will be done when someone
tries to move a direction we are blocking, unless it starts with a
'#', in which case it is just written to the user.  If it is a function,
then that function will be called with the direction and the person
as args, and the move will be allowed only if the function returns 1.
