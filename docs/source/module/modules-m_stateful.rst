********************

Documentation for the modules-m_stateful module in */std/modules/m_stateful.c*.

.. c:function:: varargs int is_stateful(mixed extra)

Override this to make the object stateful depending on what happens.
E.g. a torch might be stateful when lighted, but not when it's dark.
The *extra* is the argument parsed to STATE_D when registered.


.. c:function:: varargs int state_update(mixed extra)

This function must return 1 by stateful objects to keep being called by STATE_D. If they do not, they're removed from
the queue. If they do, they're added to the queue again by STATE_D and set to be called after query_call_interval()
minutes has passed.
The *extra* is the argument parsed to STATE_D when registered.
