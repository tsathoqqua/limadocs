Documentation for the modules_m_fluid_container module in */std/modules/m_fluid_container.c*.

Most containers leak.  Inherit this module into
your container so that it will fill and pour.

.. TAGS: RST

Functions
=========
.. c:function:: varargs int can_hold_fluid(mixed ob)

When fluid is passed into the fluid
container, this function is called with
the fluid object as the argument.  returns
1 by default, but this function can be
overridden if this container is limited
in the types of fluids it can hold.


.. c:function:: void set_leak_action(mixed x)

'x' is evaluated if this
container cannot hold the fluid
that is being put into it.


.. c:function:: void set_full_action(mixed x)

'x' is evaluated when this container
is full of fluid and can hold no more.
If it is a string, it is passed to
my_action().


.. c:function:: void move_fluid(object ob)

Moves fluid to fill the continer - if successful
it fills the container


.. c:function:: void part_move_fluid(object ob)

Moves fluid to fill the continer - if successful the quantity
transferred is limited to the original quantity


.. c:function:: int fill_with(object fluid)

Attempts to completely fill the container
(eg fill from source, such as tap)


.. c:function:: int part_fill_with(object fluid)

Attempts to fill the container, but limited to amount of fluid
(eg fill one container from another, by "pour")
