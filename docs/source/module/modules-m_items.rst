Simple Items

Simple items should be things that were mentioned in your long description
that  are just there for decoration.  You can look at them, give them
adjectives, and make it give error messages back other than the default,
"That doesn't make any sense!" type message.

The following example creates an old, faded sign that you can't read, that
also answers to 'board' (just for the example.

   add_item ("sign", "board",
             ([ "adjs" : ({ "old", "faded" }),
                "read" : "The sign is too faded to read.",
                "look" : "The sign is very faded.",
                "get"  : "It would probably crumble to dust!",
             ]) );

However, if you actually want to be able to read the sign, or get the sign,
you need to make an object for it.

DEPRECATED:

The old "add_item ("dust", "There is a lot of it!");" style is still
valid, but remains in only for compatability reasons.
