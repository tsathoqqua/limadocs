 Kuzushi Waza is a Karate technique not very known in MMA and other martial
 arts, itâ€™s primarily exclusive to Karate. Kuzushi Waza consists of throwing a
 cross as if you want to reach the opponent jaw but instead you go with your
 hand to the side of his neck and then you step forward with your leg putting
 it right behind the opponent, this way, your opponent becomes trapped between
 your arm in front and your leg behind. After that all you have to do is drive
 through your opponent and he will automatically lose his balance and you will
 take him down effortlessly.
