Documentation for the goto command in */cmds/wiz/goto.c*.

Command
=======

See: :doc:`Command: wizz <wizz>` :doc:`Command: trans <trans>` 

USAGE:

    |``goto <player>``
    |  ``goto <room>
The goto command is a simple method of teleportation which can move you
either to a specific room or to whatever room a certain player is in.

If the room is in your current directory,
the filename indicates the destination.

eg	``goto workroom.c``

If the room is not in your current directory,
the full path (/directory/filename) format should be used.

eg	``goto /wiz/azy/workroom.c``
