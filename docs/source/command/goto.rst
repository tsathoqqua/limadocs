Command
=======

See: `Command: wizz <(wizz.html>`_ `Command: trans <(trans.html>`_ 

USAGE::

	goto <player>
	goto <room>
	The goto command is a simple method of teleportation which can move you
	either to a specific room or to whatever room a certain player is in.

If the room is in your current directory,
the filename indicates the destination.

eg	goto workroom.c

If the room is not in your current directory,
the full path (/directory/filename) format should be used.

eg	goto /wiz/azy/workroom.c
