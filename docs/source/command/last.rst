Command
=======

USAGE: ``last [-s] [-n count] [-d days] [-D days] [user1 user2 ...]``

  |  -s       : be "silent" -- trim headers, displaying just the data
  |  -n count : only display this many users (the most recent)
  |  -d days  : display users logged in WITHIN this many days
  |  -D days  : display users logged in OLDER than this many days

  |  user...  : display login information for these users

Note that the options can be combined, but you'll get an error if you
use -d and -D to, say, ask for all users logged in during the past 30
days and those logged in before 60 days ago.

For each user found, their name is displayed, when they
logged in, if they are still on or when they logged out, and where they
connected from.
