Command *mv*
*************

Documentation for the mv command in */trans/cmds/mv.c*.

Command
=======

USAGE:  ``mv  source destination``

This command will allow you to move files from source to
destination.  The source file must exist, the destination may or
may not exist at the time of the move.  If the destination does
not exist one will be created, if the destination does exist, at
the time of the move it will be overwritten.  The source file will
be removed.

It thus provides a "rename" facility for files.

If you do not supply a full path name mv will assume that the
files will be in your current directory.

``mv wizroom.c workroom.c``

I will now have workroom.c in the current directory and wizroom.c
  will no longer exist.

``cp /domains/std/wizroom.c /wiz/zifnab/workroom.c``

I now have workroom.c in my home directory and wizroom.c no longer
exists.
