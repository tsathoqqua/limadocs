Command
=======

USAGE

   |``profile``
   |  ``profile <filename>``
   |  ``profile -total <filename>``
   |  ``profile all``

This displays time taken processing specified functions.
To use this, the driver must be compiled with the PROFILE_FUNCTIONS option
defined (in local_options).

Using ``profile`` without any argument displays the "top 10" objects,
together with the total time taken executing functions within them.

Using ``profile <name>`` displays the time taken in each individual function
within the specified object, split betwen "self" and "children", together
with the number of calls involved.

Using ``profile -total <name>`` produces a similar display, but sorted on the
"Total" column rather than "Self"

The "``profile all``" option is likely to produce a "Too long evaluation" error,
unless you increase the max eval cost, but it should provide details of
time taken by functions in the 20 "worst" objects.
