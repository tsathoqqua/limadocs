Command *clean*
****************

Documentation for the wiz-clean command in */cmds/wiz/clean.c*.

Command
=======

See: `Command:  <dest.html>`_ `Command:  <clone.html>`_ 

USAGE:  
   |  ``clean``
   |  ``clean <target>``

This command will destroy everything in your environment if
executed with no args. If given an argument it will destroy all
objects in that object.  Especially useful when a pesky wizard or two
clone 20 barney's in your workroom.
It ignores add_items and living objects, so perhaps it's not so helpful
with those barneys after all ...
