Command
=======

See: :doc:`Command: rst <rst>` 

USAGE ``bk <filename>``

This command allows you to backup a file.
Given the argument, file, it assumes your current
directory.

It then copies this file to ./bak/ directory while
also date stamping it. Timestamps are appended, as
well, if two files are backed up on the same day.

Also, if no ./bak/ directory exists, it automagically
creates one for you.
