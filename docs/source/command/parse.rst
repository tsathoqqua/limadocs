Documentation for the parse command in */cmds/wiz/parse.c*.

Command
=======

USAGE::

	parse <verb>

 Interface to the parse_sentence() debug info.
 Requires the debugging options to be compiled into the driver
(eg by "./build.MudOS debug").

 Displays results of all the parser checks on the verb - which
 rule(s) it matches, and results of the can_, direct_ and indirect_
 checks as appropriate, which helps determine where it fails and
 hence why "You can't do that (with that)"
