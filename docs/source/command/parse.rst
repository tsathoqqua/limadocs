Command *parse*
****************

Documentation for the parse command in */cmds/wiz/parse.c*.

Command
=======

USAGE: ``parse <verb>``

Interface to the parse_sentence() debug info.
Requires the debugging options to be compiled into the driver
(eg by "*./build.MudOS debug*").

Displays results of all the parser checks on the verb - which
rule(s) it matches, and results of the can_, direct_ and indirect_
checks as appropriate, which helps determine where it fails and
hence why "You can't do that (with that)"
