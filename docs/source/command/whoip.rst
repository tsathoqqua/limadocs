Documentation for the whoip command in */cmds/wiz/whoip.c*.

USAGE:

    |  ``whoip``
    |  ``whoip <ip address>``
    |  ``whoip <ip number>``
    |  ``whoip <player name>``

This command is very similar to who, however it shows
the ip name and number from which each player connected,
and is only available to wizards.

The command also reports historical data of people who logged in from
a given ip given as an argument, or alternatively a list of IPs that
the player logged in from.
