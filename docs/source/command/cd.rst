Documentation for the cd command in */trans/cmds/cd.c*.

Command
=======

See: :doc:`Command: mkdir <mkdir>` :doc:`Command: ls <ls>` :doc:`Command: pwd <pwd>` :doc:`Command: ed <ed>` :doc:`Command: uncd <uncd>` 

USAGE:  ``cd [directory|obj]``

Most file commands assume you're talking about your current working
directory, if you do not specify a full path.  This command sets your
current directory.  If no argument is given,  your home directory will
become your current working dir.

``cd -`` 
Brings you to your previous working directory (like the ``uncd`` command).

With the 'obj' argument it moves you to the directory that 'obj' is in.
