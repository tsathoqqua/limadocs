Command
=======

See: :doc:`Command: echo <echo>` :doc:`Command: echoall <echoall>` :doc:`Command: m_messages <m_messages>` 

USAGE ``echo @<target> <message>``

Provides a targetted echo facility, which uses the "message" syntax.
If the target cannot be found, it is ignored - ie the message is treated
as a "simple_action" - so presence of $t in the message would cause error.


>``echom @fred $N $vtest the echom command on $t``

> You test the echom command on Fred
and Fred and onlookers would see suitably adjusted versions.
