Documentation for the objcount command in */cmds/wiz/objcount.c*.

Command
=======

See: :doc:`Command: objdump <objdump>` :doc:`Command: objfind <objfind>` 

USAGE:

   |  ``objcount
   |  ``objcount <minimum>

This command is used to find objects that have more than one instance.
The number of instances (including blueprint) for each qualifying item
is printed along with that object.

Note: the "blueprint" is counted as an instance in display,
but not for determining whether the item qualifies.

When the optional "minimum" parameter is used, this ignores any items
where the number of instances (excluding blueprint) is less than the number
Thus "``objcounts 2``" lists items with 3 or more non-blueprint instances,
