Command *emotem*
*****************

Documentation for the emotem command in */cmds/wiz/emotem.c*.

Command
=======

See: :doc:`Command: emote <emote>` :doc:`Command: echom <echom>` 

USAGE: ``emotem @<target> <message>``

Sends a targetted message, using the M_MESSAGE syntax (as for souls).
As with other emotes, the senders name is prepended as part of the message.
If the target cannot be found, it is ignored - ie the message is treated
as a "simple_action" - so presence of $t in the message would cause error.


>``echom @fred $vtest the emotem command on $t``

>You test the echom command on Fred
and Fred and onlookers would see suitably adjusted versions.
