Command *rst*
**************

Documentation for the rst command in */trans/cmds/rst.c*.

Command
=======

See: :doc:`Command: bak <bak>` 

USAGE ``rst <filename>``

Restores a previous backup of a file.

This command takes one argument, either a path and a file or just a
file. It will then prompt you, asking which file you'd like to restore
from.

Obviously, restorations will fail if no "bak" directory is
present off the given path, or if the file has not been
previously backed up.

Menu item ? will show your selection, again. Menu item
q will cancel the restoration process.
