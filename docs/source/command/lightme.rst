Documentation for the lightme command in */cmds/wiz/lightme.c*.

Command
=======

USAGE::

	 lightme <number>

This command will allow any wizard to turn himself into a light source,
thus illuminating any dark room he is in.
You can also darken a lit room into a dark room by using a negative number,
and turning into a light sink.

The number 1 should suffice to illuminate dark rooms, and -1 to darken
lit ones (unless another wizard is present, trying the same thing).
To clear the effect, use "lightme 0".
