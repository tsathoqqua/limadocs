Command *people*
*****************

Documentation for the people command in */cmds/wiz/people.c*.

Command
=======

syntax: ``people [flags]``

Shows a list of players and associated info, with the flags determining
which players and info are included

Instead of calling the cmd with flags you can do:
``set people_flags [flags]`` the flags that you appoint will be automatically
 used as your default arguments when the command is called.

ex:
``set people_flags hpnI``
or
``people hpnI``

The available flags are as follows.
 | --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  W -This flag will show wizards only. It will not print anything, it just
 |    filters the users and removes anyone without wizard status.
 |  P -This flag shows players only. Another filter, this command just removes
 |    any wizards from the who list.
 |  A -This flag shows admins (demigods or Gods) only.
 |  D -This flag adds an informative line of info triggered by other flags, fex.
 |    if your command supports the 'W' flag the info line would print:
