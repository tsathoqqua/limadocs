Command *cp*
*************

Documentation for the cp command in */trans/cmds/cp.c*.

Command
=======

USAGE:  ``cp  <source> <destination>``

This command will allow you to copy files from source to
destination.  The source file must exist, the destination may or
may not exist at the time of the copy.  If the destination does
not exist one will be created, if the destination does exist, at
the time of the copy it will be overwritten.

The optional flag f can be used to force it to overwrite -

``cp -f wizroom.c workroom.c``

If you do not supply a full path name cp will assume that the
files will be in your current directory.

``cp wizroom.c workroom.c``

I will now have a copy of wizroom.c named workroom.c in the
current directory.

``cp /domains/std/wizroom.c /wiz/zifnab/workroom.c``

I now have a copy of wizroom.c in my home directory named workroom.c

Like the \*nix cp command, it can also be used with multiple source files
(eg using wildcard) provided the destination is a directory - eg

``cp s\*.c /wiz/loriel/rooms/``

This copies all files in current directory, which have a .c suffix, and
 which start with s, to the directory /wiz/loriel/rooms/.
