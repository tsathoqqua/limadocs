Command *timer*
****************

Documentation for the timer command in */cmds/wiz/timer.c*.

Command
=======

See: :doc:`Command: channels <channels>` :doc:`Command: chan <chan>` 

USAGE:  ``timer [-r] number [string  number]``

Starts a timer for some number of seconds (given by the first number).
Only one timer is allowed per person (at the moment, simply due to
implementation decisions).

If -r is provided, the timer will repeat until stopped.

If a string and number is given, then this is for displaying
the timer notifications over a channel (rather than just to you).
The number specifies how often a notice should be given.  The
channel name should be the internal channel name or a player
channel name (plyr_XXX provided by the "chan" command).

The timer may be stopped by passing 0 for the timer (e.g. "timer 0").

Examples:
> ``timer 600 clock 60``	-- 10 minute timer, notify on "clock" channel
			   every minute
> ``timer -r 300``		-- repeating 5 minute timer; notifies you
			   directly.
> ``timer 30 wiz_wiz 5``	-- 30 second timer, notifying every 5 seconds
			   on the wizard channel
