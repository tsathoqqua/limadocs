Command *telnet*
*****************

Documentation for the telnet command in */trans/admincmds/telnet.c*.

Command
=======

USAGE: ``telnet``

Invokes the mud's telnet client for you.

Admin only
The prompt will change to #, meaning you're in telnet mode.
Any input not directly to the telnet program will go to your
average shell instead.

Text received from a telnet session will start with the tilde  ( '~' ).

Telnet understands the following commands:

  |  exit  -- quit telnet

  |  open [address|mudname]  -- opens a new telnet session.
	  |  mudname can be any mud name or a unique part
	  |  of a mud name based on the muds you can see
	  |  by typing: "mudlist".
	  |  Right now if you use an address, it must be
	  |  an ip number, and not an ip name.
	  |  If you have more than one session open,
	  |  you'll only be interacting with the current
	  |  session.

  |  jobs  -- shows what sessions you have open.

  |  goto [job#] -- changes your active session to the given number
	  |  (if you have more than one session)

  |  tog   -- toggles whether or not your regular input should go to the active
	  |  session or to the mud you're on.  By default it goes to the mud
	  |  you're on.

  |  send <str>  -- send input to the active session.  You don't need to do this
	  |  if you've done /tog once, you can just type the input and
	  |  it goes.

  |  close -- closes the currently active session.

  |  hide  -- You don't see any of the text from remote telnet connections if
	  |  you use this.  /hide again to bring the text back.

  |  help		-- This document.
  |  ?

! as the first character always sends your input to your command shell
instead of a telnet session.  To send a string to a telnet session that
starts with a !, use ``/send !string``.

N.B.  Some people have a hard time using / with tinyfugue.  If you need to
change the control character, set the telnet_char environment variable.

EG:
	  ``set telnet_char %``
