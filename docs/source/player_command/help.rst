Player Command
==============

USAGE

  |  ``help``
  |  ``help <topic>``

With no arguments, you are sent into the general help menu.  You may instead, pass a topic as an argument.

Within the help system, when you are at the
    ``Help topic? [?]``

prompt, you can enter another topic for help on that.  Do not enter 'help' as you do from the command line.  Just the
topic name.

If there are more than one topic with the same name that you select, you will be given the option of selecting which
//match you wish to read.

Help files are paged through the MUD's standard 'more' pager.  For help on that please refer to the help page for
more, or type ? or h at the more prompt.
