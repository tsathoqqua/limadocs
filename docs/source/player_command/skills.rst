USAGE
   ``skills``

Prints out a list of your skills and skill ranks.

- Skill ranks are shown at the end of the skills (the higher the better from 0-20)
- Training points, if used, are shown at the end of the skill bars (in yellow)

The more you use your skills, the better you get. So things get better all
the time! Talk to a trainer to learn more about skills.
