Player Command
==============

USAGE
   ``converse``

Puts you into conversation mode, which means that anything you type
will act as if you are placing the ``say`` command before it.  Once in
conversation mode, you exit the same way you do from the mail or
bulletin board editor, that is, by typing a '.' alone on a line.  You
may also issue commands while in conversation mode by putting a !
before whatever you type.
