Player Command
==============

USAGE
    ``suicide``

This would allow you to completely obliterate your character from the game,
leaving no trace.
However, we're sure you wouldn't really want to do that,
so we've disabled it.
If you really really do want to be removed completely and irrevocably,
then mail the request to one of the admins.
