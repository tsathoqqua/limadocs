USAGE

  |  ``hints``
  |  ``hints on``
  |  ``hints off``
  |  ``hints <item>``

``hints on`` turns on hints for the MUD while you move around. It's highly recommended
for new or inexperienced players. Some hints may pop up from the rooms you enter, whereas
others may be from items your have in your inventory - ``hints <item>`` can be used to
check if there are any hints for a specific items usage.
