USAGE

   |   ``emoji``
   |   ``emoji on``
   |   ``emoji off``
   |   ``emoji list``

Typing ``emoji`` will show if your character is set to ascii like graphics
from the mud (used for small charts etc). These can be hard to use on
screen readers, so if you are using a screen reader it can be recommended
to be ``emoji off`` - ``simplify on`` will set  alot of these settings
correct for your screen reader.

Use ``emoji list`` for a list of supported emojis.
