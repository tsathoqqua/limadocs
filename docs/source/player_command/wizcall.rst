Player Command
==============

USAGE
    ``wizcall <message>``

The wizcall command will let you send a message to all logged-in
wizards.  This command is to be used ONLY for reporting dead-end
traps, or other bugs that require immediate wizard assistance. Bugs
not requiring the immediate attention of a wizard should be reported
via ``bug`` instead. The excessive use of this command is grounds for
removal of your character.
