Player Command
==============

See: :doc:`channels <channels>` :doc:`gossip <gossip>` :doc:`newbie <newbie>` 

The chan command is the central command for all channel
communication.  Below are the various forms the command takes:

  |  ``chan``                    - list channels being listened to
  |  ``chan gossip``             - find out whether the 'gossip' channel is being listened to
  |  ``chan gossip /on``         - turn listening on for the 'gossip' channel
  |  ``chan gossip /off``        - stop listening to 'gossip'
  |  ``chan gossip /list``       - find out who is listening to 'gossip'
  |  ``chan gossip /who``        - same as /list
  |  ``chan gossip /last``       - show the last 20 messages on the channel
  |  ``chan gossip <msg>``       - send <msg> to all listeners
  |  ``chan gossip ;<feeling>``  - perform <feeling> over the channel (e.g. chan gossip ;grin)
  |  ``chan gossip :<emote>``    - send <emote> to all listeners (e.g. chan gossip :wants a big sword!)
  |  ``chan mine /new``          - create the "mine" channel

Of course, the 'gossip' may be replaced with any channel name you
might want to use.

chan will create a channel, if necessary, when you first start
to listen to it.  There are (currently) no restrictions on the
number or channels you may listen to or create.  Once you listen
to a channel, you can simply use its name for operating the channel.

Two player channels are standard: gossip and newbie

Some examples:

  |  > ``chan``
  |  You are listening to: gossip, newbie, mychannel
  |  > ``chan gossip /off``
  |  You are no longer listening to 'gossip'.
  |  > ``mychannel /list``
  |  Users listening to 'mychannel': Johndoe, Smurfhead, Tarzan
  |  > ``mychannel hello!``
  |  [mychannel] Smurfhead: hello!
  |   > ``mychannel :turns a bright shade of blue``
  |  [mychannel] Smurfhead turns a bright shade of blue.
  |  > ``mychannel :laugh tarzan``
  |  [mychannel] You laugh at Tarzan.
  |  >
  |  > [mychannel] Tarzan bops you on the nose.
