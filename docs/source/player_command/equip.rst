Player Command
==============

See: :doc:`skills <skills>` :doc:`hp <hp>` :doc:`stats <stats>` :doc:`score <score>` :doc:`materials <materials>` 

USAGE
  ``equip``

Shows your wielded and worn weapons and armours, their durability
and some primary stats. The command also shows your spell failure chance
which increases with the more medium and heavy armour you wear, the latter
having a greater impact.

Reparing and salvaging
----------------------

You can repair your gear using the ``repair`` verb using components from
``salvage`` if you are next to a crafting bench. The components can be
seen by using the ``materials`` command.

You can easily salvage by using ``salvage all`` which will salvage all
your damaged equipment. You can salvage other things by salvaging
them one by one, i.e. ``salvage mace`` to salvage your non-damaged mace.

Use ``repair all`` to repair all your equipment. The command will give you
an estimate of the cost in materials and coins (if needed) before you
decide to repair or not. Be careful not to repair things you do not want
to keep. It does not pay to repair things you want to sell.
