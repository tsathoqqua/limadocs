Player Command
==============

See: :doc:`mode <mode>` :doc:`palette <palette>` 

USAGE
  |   ``colours``
  |   ``colours <name> <value>``
  |   ``colours remove <value>``

This command handles customising the colours displayed in the mud -
ie changing them to suit your tastes
Some of types items displayed in the mud are allocated a "colour name",
which is then given a default "colour value"
eg "say" could be given a value "blue", in which case all "says" would
appear in blue. If you wish to have them appear in red, you would use:

  |   ``colours say red``
  |   ``colours say <021>``

You can also use "bold" as a colour, with comma if necessary - eg::
    ``colour say bold,red``

You can clear your personalised setting, and revert to the mud default, with::
    ``colours remove say``

Instead of colour names, check the ``palette`` command and use numbers from there,
from 001 to 255.
