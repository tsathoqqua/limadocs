Player Command
==============

USAGE

  |   ``finger``
  |   ``finger player``
  |   ``finger @mudname``
  |   ``finger player@mudname``

Gives you information about a player named.  If you do not mention a
particular mud, it searches for that player info here.  If you do not
mention a player or a mud, it gives general finger info for everyone
on line here.  If you mention another mud but no player, it gives you
general info on the players on that mud.

The mud name doesn't have to be the complete name, and can be a
partial match, as long as you provide enough information so that the
game can figure out which mud you're talking about.
