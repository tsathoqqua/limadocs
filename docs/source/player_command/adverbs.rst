USAGE

  ``adverbs [pattern]``

Without an argument, shows all adverbs that you can use in soul commands.
With an argument, shows all adverbs matching the given pattern.

Example:
   ``adverbs f*ly``

will show you all adverbs that start w/ 'f' and end in 'ly'

To use an adverb in a soul command, use as much of the adverb as necessary
to uniquely identify it, followed by a \*.

For example:
   ``smile fla*``

will translate to: *smile flatly*.

But: ``smile fl*`` will not, because *flirtingly* also starts with 'fl'.
