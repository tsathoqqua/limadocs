Daemon event_d
***************

Documentation for the daemons-event_d daemon in */daemons/event_d.c*.

Module Information
==================

The event_d handles events on the MUD, and can schedule things either in "real world time" or on MUD time. How time
is defined on the mud is defined in <config/time.h> and should be configured there via admtool.

       ``admtool`` -> Game configuration -> Settings

The event_d only handles day names, hours, minutes and seconds and disregards day count, day in a  month, month names
and years. This is left up to you to extend should you want to.

This daemon on purpose does not handle event like the yearly filling of the Xmas stockings or things that happen
rarely - they are left for the wizards to kick off. This daemon handles things that happen often enough that players
should experience them a few times per week depending on the settings in the */include/config/time.h* file.

Thus the main focus is on weekly scheduled events, i.e. John goes to the bank at 16 with money suitcase Wednesdays
and Saturdays ("00 16 2,5"), Bob goes to the cafe to buy a sandwich for lunch everyday (except Sunday) at 11:45
("45 11 0-6").
