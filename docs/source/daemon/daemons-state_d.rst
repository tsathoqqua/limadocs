Daemon state_d
***************

Documentation for the daemons-state_d daemon in */daemons/state_d.c*.

Module Information
==================

This daemon periodically calls objects on the MUD to allow them to change state. This can
be used to grow crops, make food rot, make critically wounded things die.

This daemon runs on a heartbeat, so is as granular as the heartbeat settings.
See M_STATEFUL, M_DECAY, LIGHT_OBJECT and ^std/consumable/hamburger.c for some examples of usage.

Functions
=========
.. c:function:: varargs void add_to_queue(object ob, int add_to_time, int force, mixed extra)

Adds ob to queue, to be scheduled at NOW + add_to_time in minutes.
If force=1, the object is added even if already in queue.


.. c:function:: varargs void add_to_queue_secs(object ob, int add_to_time, int force, mixed extra)

Useful for faster testing, should probably not be used in the real mudlib.
If it's this brief, then use a call_out(). See add_to_queue for documentation.
This function adds seconds, and not minutes.


.. c:function:: varargs void add_to_queue_at_time(mixed ob, int update_time, mixed extra)

Add to queue at a specific time. No checks, no requirements.


.. c:function:: varargs void remove_from_queue(object ob, mixed extra)

Removes ob from the queue nomatter when scheduled.
